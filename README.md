# Redesigning the Washington State Department of Ecology Website

## Introduction
This project was centered around redesigning the Washington State Department of Ecology website in order to make the copious amounts of information more accessible, as well as more relevant to the general. The environment is in a precarious state, and more effort must be put towards protecting it; therefore, making the Department of Ecology website more accessible is a way to encourage people to practice protecting the natural environment. In my redesign of the website, I added a feature that allows users to sort the many regulations and permits as necessary. This was designed with professionals working at various businesses in mind, so that they are able to stay organized and ensure their respective businesses are able to follow all environmental regulations. The other feature added was one that encourages the general public to volunteer for various environmental causes through the implementation of a convenient volunteering portal that allows users to sign up for opportunities directly on the website.  

## Design Statement
As protecting the environment is an overwhelming but important task, I wanted to make this task less daunting by implementing features that will make it more accessible to a variety of people, depending on the role that they play. As it is now, the website does not allow user-friendly interaction with the various resources offered; for example, the great amount of regulations and permits are hard to peruse and organize depending on a common topic. I also wanted to help those that want to act to benefit the environment but don't know how or where to start be able to take their first step more easily. 

## Competitor Analysis
At the beginning of the project, I conducted a heuristic evaluation on the Washington State Department of Ecology website to determine what improvements could be made to the site. I found that the orginial website, while simple and informational, seems to be lacking in functionality; though it is a great resource for information if you know what you are looking for, other users may find the website bereft of any substantial use. I wanted to improve the permits and regulations portion of the site with more features and functionality, so that users will be able to navigate the information more efficiently.  
I also conducted a pilot usability test using the same Department of Ecology website. Through this usability test, I discovered that the tabs on the menu are not very descriptive, and the user therefore had difficultly navigating certain parts of the website. Additionally, even though there were moments where the search bar would have come in handy, the user decided not to use it; this made me think that it should be placed in a more prominent position or made bigger and more obvious.

## User Research
In order to better understand the issues identified through my pilot usability test, I conducted user research. I decided to do this through participant observation and conducting an interview to understand how users find and interact with the websites regarding the environment. I had my participant research where to find environmental volunteering opportunities and observed her actions as she did so. During the interview, I was able to gain insight on how an average person may view their actions towards helping the environment; that is, the environment, as massive as it is and with as many issues as it has, can be very overwhelming to just one person. This made me realize that it is imperative to make a website regarding the environment as user-friendly as possible, so as not to negatively impact users' cognitive load any more than necessary.

## UX Storytelling
In order to better visualize possible users' perspectives, I created personas that served as potential users of my website. Creating personas is an essential step in user experience design, as it allows designers to keep in mind potential users as they are designing a product for them. Using personas can help designers prevent their personal biases from effecting the product as they design while keeping in mind users. For this project, I created 2 personas; one persona was intended to be a professional working with environmental regulations, and the other was a student hoping to begin helping the environment.

## Wireframe and Graphic Design Element Variation
After creating personas and scenarios as a proposal to implement features to make the Washington State Department of Ecology website more accessible, I then constructed low-fidelity prototypes that model the implementation of such features. In particular, I wanted to create a user portal that allows users to keep track of regulations and permits, as well as a volunteering portal through which users can easily find volunteer opportunities.

Once I drafted these wireframes, I had a user test them to ensure that the flow was clear. Then, I created the design digitally on Figma. As I created the system design, I wanted to choose elements that were as close to the original website as possible, so that it would appear cohesively integrated into the Washington State Department of Ecology website.

## High-Fidelity Prototype
After creating low-fidelity prototypes and finalizing the graphic design elements, I created a high-fidelity prototype of my website using Figma. Through user feedback, I was able to make various edits and finalize the design of the graphic interface, and was able to create an interactive prototype which can be viewed below.
